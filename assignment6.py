#1. Create a Program to Find Simple Interest

# def simpleinterest(p, R, t):
#      R = R / 100
#      amount = (p * R * t) / 100
#      print(f"The amount of interest is: ", amount)

# simpleinterest(50000, 30, 5)


#2. Create a Program to Find Body Mass Index(BMI=(weight)/(height squared))

# weight = float(input("Enter the weight of the person:"))
# height = float(input("Enter the height of the person:"))

# BMI = (weight) / (height ** 2)
# print("The BMI of the person is: ", BMI)


#3. Create a Program to Find Area of a Triangle.(Area= 1/2 * base *height)

# base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle:"))
# height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle:"))
# area = 1/2 * base * height
# print("The area of the triangle is:", area)



#4. Create a Program to Find Area of a Circle (Area = 22/7 * radius ** 2)

# radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle:"))
# area = 22/7 * radius ** 2
# print("The area of the circle is:", area)



#5. Given below dictionary
shopping = {
'sugar': 120,
'rice': 200,
'milk': 60,
'bread': 60
}

# Do the following
# 1. Print this dictionary

for item in shopping:
     print(item)
# 2. Find the sum of all items in above dictionary.




#6. Please attempt the following question:
#Suppose we have a dictionary:

person = {'john': 40, 'peter': 45}

# What happens when we try to retrieve a value using the expression print(person['susan']).

# print(person['susan'])#*Error message the value will not be obtained



# Please show your working on how you arrived to your choice below, give one choice below
# a) Since “susan” is not a value in the set, Python raises a KeyError exception

# print(person['susan'])
# b) It is executed fine and no exception is raised, and it returns None
# c) Since “susan” is not a key in the set, Python raises a KeyError exception
# d) Since “susan” is not a key in the set, Python raises a syntax error


#7. Create a List of town and reverse it.
towns = ("Nairobi", "Mombasa", "Nakuru", "Eldoret", "Kajiado", "Kisii", "Kisumu", "Meru", "Embu")   

print(towns)
