# We use the assignment operator(=) to assign values to a variable
#Anything that is inside of quotes ("") in python is called a string
message = "Hello There,hope everything is fine"
print(message)

message2 = " Goodbye"
print(message2)

#Concatinating variables-It is the joining of two or more variables outputs together
message3 = message + message2
print(message3)

#Variables can be named usin a letter a number and an underscore
#They can start with a letter and an underscore but not witha a number
