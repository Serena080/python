#Create a python programme that is used to calculate the simple interest given the principle 50000, rate as 5% and time as 8yrs,S1=(p*r*t)/100
principle = 50000
rate = 5/100

time = 8

product = principle * rate * time
SI = product / 100
print("The simple interest of the amount: ",SI)


#Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and jheight is i.75metres. (BMI=(weight)/(height squared))

weight = 78
height = 1.75
heightsquared = height ** 2
BMI = weight / heightsquared
print("The BMI of teh person is: ", BMI )




#Find the area an perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm.

length = 48
width = 25
area = length * width
print("The area of the rectangle is: ", area)

perimeter = (length + width) * 2
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)
